## Action item

* a goal: Distributing clear work assignments
* a change: Communicate during class, but also out of class when we have questions about what we should be working on.
* a measurement: Make sure that each memember has at least one in-progress goal on Kanban board.

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

## Retro Assessment

* We used Stop/Continue/Start outline in this retro.
* The retro went well, we found a change to increase the productivity of the group and be connected better with what others are working towards.

## Retro Outcome
* Update: 5/20 Thu (a week after the Retro 2)
* Our Retro2 experiment was clearly assigning the work so that group members know what their duties are.
* Metric: each member has at least one in-progress goal on kanban.
* Outcome: We did a thorough sprint-planning in lab06, and concluded all of the tasks we need to complete in the next three weeks for the final project. We clearly disguessed the details of our acceptance criteria for these issues, and each member was assigned at least one task. The kanban reflected our completion of the goal.
* In general, we've successfully met our goal set during the Retro2, and we'll keep the good habit of clear work distribution in the future.
