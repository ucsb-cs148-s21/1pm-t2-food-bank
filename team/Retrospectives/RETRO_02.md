## Retro Assessment

* We used Stop/Continue/Start outline in this retro.
* The retro went well, we found a change to increase the productivity of the group and be connected better with what others are working towards.
* Try to focus on making sure everyone can share their ideas during the retro, you aren't supposed to fill in the 'content' of the meeting.

## Retro Outcome
* TBD (will check back after one week, aka 5/21)
* A brief description of what your retro 2 experiment was 
* A brief recap of the metric you planned on using 
* The outcome according to the metric now that the next Sprint is done (maybe already for a while).
* Your conclusions based on this outcome. You can decide to cement this change going forward, to modify it (start a new experiment), or to discard it and go back to previous procedures.
