## Retro Assessment

* In lec05 we used start/stop/continue format for the retro. in this retro we set up a goal, a change to accomplish that goal and a measurement to quantify if we completed that goal.
* The retro went well, we found a change to increase the productivity of the group and be connected better with what others are working towards.
* Try to focus on making sure everyone can share their ideas during the retro, you aren't supposed to fill in the 'content' of the meeting.

## Retro Outcome
* Update: 4/29/2021 (outcome of retro during the MVP)
* We've successfully met our goal set during the first Retro.
* We've been frequently communicating through Discord and updating our Kanban board in a timely manner.
* We've been breaking down large tasks to smaller one (i.e. footer, debug, fill-in homepage content) so individuals who were assigned to the tasks were able to complete them without overlapping duties.
* We've created a new channel named "resources" on discord for sharing recourses.
