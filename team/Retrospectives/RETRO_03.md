* We see clear improvements in the technical skills we possess compare to the beginning of the project.

## Retro Assessment

* We used Stop/Continue/Start outline in this retro.
* Team members continue to check up with each other. We confirmed we are on the right track to complete the project.
* We continue to double-check our responsibilities; each team member has clear goals to accomplish.
* We start working on the non-technicals such as the user manual as the product has come to completion.
* We stop adding new features/adding new items on the Kanban board.

## Retro Outcome
* Update: 6/3 (a week after the Retro 3)
* Our Retro3 experiment was assigning the work so that group members know what their duties are. Our Retro3 experiment marks the finishing line of our project.
* Metric: Each member completes their assigned task, check-in with teammates till all in-progress tasks on the Kanban board are finished.
* Outcome: The Kanban reflected our completion of the goal. Last week, teamwork and interactions between team members drastically increased. We completed implementing the desired functionality for our project and are finishing debugging. The user manual is being polished, and the demonstration video is being recorded.
* We've successfully met our goal set during the Retro3, and we kept the excellent habit of specific work distribution and cooperation.
