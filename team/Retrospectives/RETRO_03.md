## Action item

* a goal: Perfect current funcionalities, move every task on Kanban to done column.
* a change: Distribute work of different aspects, coding and paper work, determine responsibilities.
* a measurement: Check in with teammates more often; make sure to pull from main.

## Optional

* Complete other lab requirements, such as writing the user manual.

## Retro Assessment

* We used Stop/Continue/Start outline in this retro.
* The retro went well, we found a change to increase the productivity of the group and be connected better with what others are working towards.
* Try to focus on making sure everyone can share their ideas during the retro, you aren't supposed to fill in the 'content' of the meeting.

## Retro Outcome
* Update: 6/3 (a week after the Retro 3)
* Our Retro2 experiment was clearly assigning the work so that group members know what their duties are.
* Metric: each member has at least one in-progress goal on kanban.
* Outcome: We did a thorough sprint-planning in lab06, and concluded all of the tasks we need to complete in the next three weeks for the final project. We clearly disguessed the details of our acceptance criteria for these issues, and each member was assigned at least one task. The kanban reflected our completion of the goal.
* In general, we've successfully met our goal set during the Retro2, and we'll keep the good habit of clear work distribution in the future.
