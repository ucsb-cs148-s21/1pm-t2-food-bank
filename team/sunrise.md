Hi, everyone. My name is Sunrise. I am a third-year CS major. I am a transfer student too, so I have started my major a bit later than usual, but very excited to learn new stuff with you guys, and keep myself prepared to catch up anytime.

Sorry for the late reply, I have read you guys' ideas. I agree with Liuhao for mocking data if we are unable to get access to the database for the foodbank. Also, a discord is definitely useful for our project. I would suggest we create one as well.

For the team norms, while making sure everyone is comfortable to work and talk together, communication is definitely the key as well as being respectful. Sharing ideas, asking, and answering questions can keep our team being active.
