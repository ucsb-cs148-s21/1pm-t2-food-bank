# Sunrise's work

1. Initializing and setup firebase as our database.
2. Connecting firebase to our backend spring framework. (Kaiwen helped me debugging)
3. Setting up java objects which to be used for database and essential APIs for our project.
4. Creating a timestamp which dislpays last updated time on both inventory page and staff portal page. (Liuhao shared ideas, and Kaiwen helped me debugging)
5. Backend code clean-up, fixing small issues, and some beautifying on frontend.
6. Some essential documentions contribution.
7. ** I first tried initializing MongoDB and tried connecting to our backend, but failed to do so, then switched to Firebase. Since the first try was failed I did not commit to our github, the graph might not show about that. **
