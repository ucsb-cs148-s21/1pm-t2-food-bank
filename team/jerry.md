# Brief Intro
Hello, this is Jerry Wang. I'm a third year CS Major, I can code in c++, java, python and I know a bit javascript. I am applying the UCSB  BSMS program and graduate programs in other universities. I would like to advance my studies in Artificial Intelligance and Algorithms.


# Idea Description

Since we do not have the data from the food bank, we need to simulate some data.Maybe we need some sort of database.

We will use java, javascript + suroku to do this project.

In HW00, the professor introduces us the "Agile" way of programming. The three questions in Scrum can be useful, and we should use this kind of format during our weekly meeting.

I suggest we should meet after class, and during section, at least three times a week. The talk can be breif, like a 5 minute checkup.
