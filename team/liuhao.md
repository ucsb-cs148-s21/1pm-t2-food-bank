# Brief Intro
My name is Liuhao Wu. I am a second year CS major. I can code in C++, C#, Python. I have not much experience with Java/JavaScript, but I am taking CS156 concurrently. I seem to be the less experienced one in the team but am excited to learn new stuff.

# Idea Description
In the current stage, I don't think we can have access to the data from food banks (or do they even maintain a database), but one of the LAs told me that we could just mock data for testing purposes. For team collaboration, I think efficient communication is the key. I really like Jerry's practice of using polls to collect everyone's ideas.
