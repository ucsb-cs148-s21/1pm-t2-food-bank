# Agreements:

- Keep up communication with the team via Slack or Discord.
- Try to keep working each week so we don't fall behind.
- When one of us is absent for an unavoidable reason, we will let the other team members know on the team slack channel, in advance when possible, as soon as possible afterwards when not.
- We will each try to keep such absences to a minimum, especially for lectures and Fri 8am section.
- Those of us that are present will do our best to share with the absent team member(s) what they missed and help them get back up to speed.
- We will all do our best to contribute to the teams success.
