## UCent Food Bank
This Webapp aims to provide students information about what items are available at the food bank, so students don't need to come to the food bank and leave empty handed because the food they want is unavailable.

## Grand Vision
Know the availability and quantity of items at the food bank before physically being there

## User Roles

1. If I am a student, I can check the app so that I know what is in the food bank.

2. If I am a student, I can check the app for â€œwhat's the daily special menu", avaliavity for food that I want, or looking for a restock of specific food that I have been wanting.

3. If I am a student, I can also check the app for the people's review of food before I order mine.

4. If I am a staff, I want to know what kind and quantity of food are distributed today to better arrange tomorrow's orders. The staff will have permission to edit content on the wepapp and give other users admin permissions.

5. As a user, I want to click the contact form on contact us page so that I can submit a message to UCSB food bank staff.

## Functionality
- Going to our web app, user can click a NavBar item called inventory, where they can find the a list of food items with their categories, quantities, and limitations. User also has access to the search bar to search a food item based on its category or name.
- After logging in, verified staff can login and access the staff portal page to modify food bank inventory.
- Going to the contact us page, user can submit a contact us form to ucsb food bank staff. After submitting the form, user will receive an auto-reply emails and staff member can receive an email notification listing the form user has submitted. Currently, all incoming contact us forms are directed to liuhaowu@ucsb.edu.

## Known Issues & Recommendations

- In short 10 weeks of the class, we mainly focused on the implementation of our web app functionality, and thus advanced UI and aesthetics design is required in the future.
- There's a existing Food Bank web app for introductional info (i.e. history, staff info, etc) and our web app is for intereactable and dynamic inventory data access. Consult with UCSB Food Bank administrators about integrating these two apps is recommended in the future.
