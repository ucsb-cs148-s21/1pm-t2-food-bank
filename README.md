## UCent food bank
This Webapp aims to provide students information about what items are available at the food bank, so students don't need to come to the food bank and leave empty handed because the food they want is unavailable.

## Grand Vision
Know the availability and quantity of items at the food bank before physically being there

# Installation
### Prerequisites
TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which version(s) of your framework(s) of choice)

### Dependencies
TODO: List which libraries / add-ons you added to the project, and the purpose each of those add-ons serves in your app.

# Installation Steps
TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you give complete instructions to get your project going from scratch). Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. Note that with the use of GitHub Actions, these instructions can eventually be fully automated (e.g. with act, you can run GitHub Actions locally).

# Functionality

3. If I am a student, I can also check the app for the people's review of food before I order mine.

4. If I am a staff, I want to know what kind and quantity of food are distributed today to better arrange tomorrow's orders. The staff will have permission to edit content on the wepapp and give other users admin permissions.

5. If I am a researcher, I want to know the usage of the UCSB food bank and the popularity of each kind of food among students to better accomodate students' needs.
A researcher needs to get admin permission by the staff.
