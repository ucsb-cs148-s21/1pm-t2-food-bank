## UCent Food Bank
This Webapp aims to provide students information about what items are available at the food bank, so students don't need to come to the food bank and leave empty handed because the food they want is unavailable.

## Grand Vision
Know the availability and quantity of items at the food bank before physically being there

## Known Issues & Recommendations

- In short 10 weeks of the class, we mainly focused on the implementation of our web app functionality, and thus advanced UI and aesthetics design is required in the future.
- There's a existing Food Bank web app for introductional info (i.e. history, staff info, etc) and our web app is for intereactable and dynamic inventory data access. Consult with UCSB Food Bank administrators about integrating these two apps is recommended in the future.
