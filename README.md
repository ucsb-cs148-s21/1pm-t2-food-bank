## UCent Food Bank
This Webapp aims to provide students information about what items are available at the food bank, so students don't need to come to the food bank and leave empty handed because the food they want is unavailable.

## Grand Vision
Know the availability and quantity of items at the food bank before physically being there

## User Roles

1. If I am a student, I can tell know what items are in the food bank and their corresponding quantities.
2. If I am a student, I can looking for a restock of specific food that I have been wanting.
3. If I am a staff, I can know what kind and quantity of food are distributed today to better arrange tomorrow's orders.
4. If I am a staff, I will have permission to edit content on the wepapp, insert, modify, and delete items and give other users admin permissions.
4. As a user, I can use the contact form on contact us page to submit a message to UCSB food bank staff.

## Functionality
- Going to our web app, user can click a NavBar item called inventory, where they can find the a list of food items with their categories, quantities, and limitations. User also has access to the search bar to search a food item based on its category or name.
- After logging in, verified staff can login and access the staff portal page to modify food bank inventory.
- Going to the contact us page, user can submit a contact us form to ucsb food bank staff. After submitting the form, user will receive an auto-reply emails and staff member can receive an email notification listing the form user has submitted. Currently, all incoming contact us forms are directed to liuhaowu@ucsb.edu.

## Known Issues & Recommendations

- In short 10 weeks of the class, we mainly focused on the implementation of our web app functionality, and thus advanced UI and aesthetics design is required in the future.
- There's a existing Food Bank web app for introductional info (i.e. history, staff info, etc) and our web app is for intereactable and dynamic inventory data access. Consult with UCSB Food Bank administrators about integrating these two apps is recommended in the future.
